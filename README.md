Got it! Since you used shell commands in your Jenkinsfile, you can update the README to reflect that and remove the sample Jenkinsfile section. Hereâ€™s the revised version:

# DevOps Task: Automated Deployment with Jenkins, Docker, Vagrant, and Ansible

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary files and configurations to automate the deployment of a Python application using Jenkins, Docker, Vagrant, and Ansible. The goal is to create a seamless pipeline for building, deploying, and managing applications in a scalable manner.

## Repository Structure

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image for the Python application.
- **application files**: Contains the source code of the Python application, templates and requirements files.
- **playbook.yml**: Ansible playbook for managing the deployment on Vagrant machines.
- **inventory**: Ansible inventory file specifying the target Vagrant machines.
- **keys/**: Folder containing private keys for Vagrant machines, enabling Jenkins to access them.
- **Jenkinsfile**: Defines the CI/CD pipeline for Jenkins.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Vagrant
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- GitHub account with a private repository

## Steps to Set Up

### 1. Push Python Code to GitHub

Push the Python application code to your private GitHub repository.

### 2. Write a Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application and push it to your repository.

### 3. Create Vagrant Machines

Create two Vagrant machines with low specifications.

### 4. Set Up Jenkins Pipeline

Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the following steps:

1. **Pull Code from GitHub**: Configure Jenkins to pull code from your GitHub repository using a credentials token.
2. **Build Docker Image**: Use the Dockerfile to build a Docker image of the application.
3. **Push Docker Image to Docker Hub**: Push the built Docker image to Docker Hub.
4. **Run Ansible Playbook**: Execute the Ansible playbook to:
   - Install Docker on the Vagrant machines.
   - Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub on the Vagrant machines.
   - Run the Docker container from the image on the Vagrant machines.

## Jenkins Configuration

To automate the deployment process, configure Jenkins as follows:

1. **Create a New Pipeline**: Set up a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
2. **Configure Pipeline Script**: Use the `Jenkinsfile` provided in this repository to define the pipeline stages.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this README, you will be able to automate the deployment of your Python application using Jenkins, Docker, Vagrant, and Ansible. This setup ensures a streamlined and efficient deployment process.
